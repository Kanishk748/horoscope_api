# Horoscope API

Node.js + Express + MongoDB API with JWT, rate limiting, and Swagger.

## Features
- Signup/Login with email + password
- Auto-detect zodiac sign from birthdate
- `GET /horoscope/today` (stores served result to history)
- `GET /horoscope/history` (last 7 days)
- Rate limit (default 5/min) for `/horoscope/*`
- Swagger UI at `/docs`

## Quickstart (Docker)
```bash
cp .env.sample .env
docker compose up --build
```

Visit:
- API: http://localhost:3000/health
- Docs: http://localhost:3000/docs

## Local dev (without Docker)
1. Start MongoDB locally or via Docker.

2. Create `.env` from sample and set `MONGODB_URI` & `JWT_SECRET`.

3. Install deps and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## API Overview
- `POST /auth/signup` { name, email, password, birthdate: YYYY-MM-DD }

- `POST /auth/login` { email, password }

- `GET /horoscope/today` (Bearer JWT)

- `GET /horoscope/history` (Bearer JWT)

## Notes
- History stores one record per day when `/horoscope/today` is fetched.

- `history` endpoint returns the last 7 calendar days (uses stored text if present).

- Keep your `JWT_SECRET` safe.

âœ… Design Decisions
1. Tech Stack
Node.js + Express.js: Chosen for rapid API development, middleware support, and non-blocking architecture.
MongoDB + Mongoose (or PostgreSQL + Sequelize): Chosen based on need for persistent user data and flexibility in schema design. Mongoose/Sequelize provide schema validation, data modeling, and query abstraction.
2. Authentication
JWT-based auth: Stateless authentication. Users receive a token on login; this is used to access protected endpoints.
Password hashing: Implemented using bcrypt to store hashed passwords securely in the DB.
Tokens are short-lived, ensuring minimal exposure window. Optionally, refresh tokens can be added.
3. User Signup / Zodiac Auto-Detection
On signup, the backend auto-calculates the zodiac sign from the user's birthdate using a helper function.
Zodiac is stored in the user document/model for fast future access.
This minimizes real-time computation on horoscope endpoints.
4. Horoscope Management
   Daily Horoscope (GET /horoscope/today):
Authenticated route.
Returns the horoscope for the user's zodiac sign based on the current date.
Horoscope texts are mocked via an in-memory or JSON-based dictionary.
History (GET /horoscope/history):
Returns the last 7 days of horoscopes served to the user.
Stored in a separate history collection/table or as a nested array in the user model.
5. Rate Limiting
Implemented via express-rate-limit middleware.
Global or route-level restriction to 5 requests per minute to prevent abuse.
Tracks based on IP or user ID (in token).
6. API Documentation
Swagger/OpenAPI integration using swagger-jsdoc and swagger-ui-express.
Documents routes, request/response schemas, and error codes for easy developer onboarding.
ðŸ“ˆ Scalability: Personalized Horoscope per User
If we evolve from static zodiac-based horoscopes to user-specific personalized horoscopes, here's what changes:
| Aspect               | Challenge                                    | Scalable Solution                                                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Storage**     | Each user has unique horoscope per day       | Store `userId`, `date`, and `horoscope` in a dedicated `horoscope_history` collection/table |
| **Generation Cost**  | Cannot reuse same horoscope for zodiac group | Use scheduled background jobs (e.g., with **Bull + Redis**) to pre-generate horoscopes      |
| **API Load**         | Increased load if generated on request       | Cache recent results per user in Redis                                                      |
| **Third-party APIs** | Costly per-user API call                     | Limit external calls, batch-fetch, or use AI-generated texts                                |
| **Latency**          | Generation may be slow                       | Async queue processing + return cached or last-known horoscope                              |
